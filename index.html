    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: January 18, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        NeuroFlux ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application (the "App").
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    
    <h3>2.1 Information You Provide</h3>
    <p>We collect information that you voluntarily provide when using the App, including:</p>

    <h2>4. AI Processing</h2>
    <p>
        Your mental health data and journal entries are processed by OpenAI's API (GPT-4o-mini) to generate personalized insights and recommendations. This processing occurs through our secure backend server. We do not share your personal information with OpenAI beyond what is necessary for providing the service.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Storage</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Local Storage:</strong> Most of your data (mental health analysis, journal entries, calendar events) is stored locally on your device using iOS's UserDefaults. This data never leaves your device unless you explicitly choose to sync it.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Backend Processing:</strong> When you use AI features, your input is temporarily sent to our backend server for processing. This data is not stored permanently on our servers.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>

        We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your information:
    </p>

        <li>Data is stored locally on your device when possible</li>
        <li>We use industry-standard security practices</li>
    </ul>
