    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: January 18, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        NeuroFlux ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application (the "App").
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    
    <h3>2.1 Information You Provide</h3>
    <p>We collect information that you voluntarily provide when using the App, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Mental Health Data:</strong> Descriptions of your mental health concerns, life aspects, and personal reflections that you choose to share for analysis</li>
        <li><strong>Mood Entries:</strong> Daily mood scores and optional comments you record in the journal</li>
        <li><strong>Calendar Events:</strong> Events and schedules you create within the App</li>
        <li><strong>AI Coach Messages:</strong> The text of your conversations with the AI Coach</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Information about how you interact with the App's features</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2 How We Collect This Data</h3>
    <p>
        This data is collected when you type and submit content in the App: when you run a life-aspects analysis, add journal entries, use the AI Coach chat, or create calendar events. Data is stored locally on your device and, when you use AI features, is sent to our servers as described below.
    </p>

    <h3>2.3 Automatically Collected Information</h3>
    <p>We may automatically collect certain information, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device information (device type, operating system version)</li>
        <li>App usage statistics</li>
        <li>Subscription status and purchase history</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the collected information to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Provide AI-powered mental health analysis and recommendations</li>
        <li>Generate personalized life aspect assessments</li>
        <li>Enable AI Coach conversations</li>
        <li>Improve and personalize your experience</li>
        <li>Process subscription payments</li>
        <li>Provide customer support</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Sharing Data with Third-Party AI and Your Consent</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>What data we send:</strong> When you use AI features (life-aspects analysis or AI Coach), the following data is sent to our backend and to a third-party AI service: the text you enter for analysis, relevant journal or context if used by the feature, and your AI Coach chat messages.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Who receives it:</strong> This data is sent to our own backend (hosted on Railway) and to <strong>OpenAI</strong> (GPT-4o-mini) for processing, so we can provide you with analysis and AI Coach responses.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Your permission:</strong> We only send this data to our servers and to OpenAI after you have given your consent in the App. The first time you use an AI feature (e.g. run an analysis or send an AI Coach message), we show a clear explanation and ask you to accept before any data is sent.
    </p>

    <h2>5. AI Processing and Third-Party Protection</h2>
    <p>
        Your mental health data, journal entries, and AI Coach messages are processed by OpenAI's API (GPT-4o-mini) to generate personalized insights and recommendations. This processing occurs through our secure backend server. We do not share your personal information with OpenAI beyond what is necessary for providing the service.
    </p>
    <p>
        OpenAI's handling of data is governed by their privacy policy. We require that our third-party AI provider offers the same or equivalent protection for your data as described in this policy. You can review OpenAI's Privacy Policy here: <a href="https://openai.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenAI Privacy Policy</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data Storage</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Local Storage:</strong> Most of your data (mental health analysis, journal entries, calendar events) is stored locally on your device using iOS's UserDefaults. This data never leaves your device unless you use AI features, in which case the content you submit is sent as described in sections 4 and 5.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Backend Processing:</strong> When you use AI features, your input is temporarily sent to our backend server and to OpenAI for processing. This data is not stored permanently on our servers.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your information:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>All data transmission is encrypted using HTTPS</li>
        <li>API keys and sensitive credentials are stored securely</li>
        <li>Data is stored locally on your device when possible</li>
        <li>We use industry-standard security practices</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We use the following third-party services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>OpenAI:</strong> For AI-powered analysis and chat features. Data you submit for AI features is sent to OpenAI for processing. See <a href="https://openai.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenAI's Privacy Policy</a></li>
        <li><strong>Apple App Store:</strong> For subscription payments. See <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple's Privacy Policy</a></li>
        <li><strong>Railway:</strong> For hosting our backend services. See <a href="https://railway.app/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Railway's Privacy Policy</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Subscription Information</h2>
    <p>
        Subscription payments are processed through Apple's App Store. We do not collect or store your payment information. Apple handles all payment processing in accordance with their privacy policy.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Your Rights</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Access your personal data stored in the App</li>
        <li>Delete your data by uninstalling the App (local data will be removed)</li>
        <li>Opt out of data collection (though this may limit App functionality)</li>
        <li>Request information about how your data is used</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>11. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        Our App is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have collected information from a child under 13, please contact us immediately.
    </p>

    <h2>12. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
        We retain your data only as long as necessary to provide our services:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Data:</strong> Stored on your device until you delete the App</li>
        <li><strong>Backend Processing:</strong> Data sent for AI processing is not stored permanently</li>
        <li><strong>Subscription Data:</strong> Retained as required by law and for service provision</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>13. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
